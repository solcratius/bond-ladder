          Diversification does not guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of
          loss.

        <li>
          Since ordinary brokerage commissions apply for each buy and sell
          transaction, frequent trading activity may increase the cost of ETFs.

      <p>
        Bonds generally present less short-term risk and volatility than stocks,
        the bond market is volatile and investing in bonds involves interest
        rate risk; as interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice
        versa. Bonds also entail issuer and counterparty credit risk, and the
        risk of default. Additionally, bonds generally involve greater inflation
        risk than stocks. Unlike individual bonds, bond funds have fees and
        expenses and most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding
        them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not
        possible. Investors should talk with their advisers regarding their
        situation before investing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss
        of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks
        similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and
        margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply.
        The funds’ return may not match the return of the underlying index. The
        funds are subject to certain other risks. Please see the current
        prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an
        investment in the funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investments focused in a particular sector are subject to greater risk,
        and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more
        diversified investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The funds are non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than
        a more diversified investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as
        interest rates rise and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the final year of the funds’ operations, as the bonds mature and
        the portfolio transitions to cash and cash equivalents, the funds’ yield
        will generally tend to move toward the yield of cash and cash
        equivalents and thus may be lower than the yields of the bonds
        previously held by the funds and/or bonds in the market.
      </p>
      <p>
        An issuer may be unable or unwilling to meet interest and/or principal
        payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and
        lowering the issuer’s credit rating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers can include
        fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability,
        and foreign taxation issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Income generated from the funds is based primarily on prevailing
        interest rates, which can vary widely over the short- and long-term. If
        interest rates drop, the funds’ income may drop as well. During periods
        of rising interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay
        principal on an obligation later than expected, resulting in a decrease
        in the value of the obligation and in a decline in the funds’ income.
      </p>
      <p>
        An issuer’s ability to prepay principal prior to maturity can limit the
        funds’ potential gains. Prepayments may require the funds to replace the
        loan or debt security with a lower yielding security, adversely
        affecting the funds’ yield.
      </p>
      <p>
        The funds currently intend to effect creations and redemptions
        principally for cash, rather than principally in-kind because of the
        nature of the funds’ investments. As such, investments in the funds may
        be less tax efficient than investments in ETFs that create and redeem
        in-kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike a direct investment in bonds, the funds’ income distributions
        will vary over time and the breakdown of returns between fund
        distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time
        of investment. For example, at times the funds may make distributions at
        a greater (or lesser) rate than the coupon payments received, which will
        result in the funds returning a lesser (or greater) amount on
        liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The rate of fund
        distribution payments may affect the tax characterization of returns,
        and the amount received as liquidation proceeds upon fund termination
        may result in a gain or loss for tax purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        During periods of reduced market liquidity or in the absence of readily
        available market quotations for the holdings of the fund, the ability of
        the fund to value its holdings becomes more difficult and the judgment
        of the sub-adviser may play a greater role in the valuation of the
        fund’s holdings due to reduced availability of reliable objective
        pricing data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds
        and can decline significantly over short time periods.
